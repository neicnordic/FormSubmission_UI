The current frontend displays dynamicaly forms selected from the navigator.
This project main components are:
- XML_FORM.
- TagChild.
- Metadata.
- TagContent.
- Schema folder.


The application works with react-redux. APP logical state are handled  APP reducer and APP actions, whereas XML form state are under the XML actions and reducers.

The component in charge of displaying the forms is XML_FORM component.
This component is subscribed into to the XML store reducer, which gets the JSON form from the selected schema.


The XML schema is set once the user selects the desired tab from the navigationBar component. This component throws an action which is setSchema,
this action is from the XML actions in the action folder. The action is a function which contains a switch that loads the tree from the schemas folder.

The schemas folder contains the a JSON tree, which contains the output of the xsd form from the releated schema type.
The folder contains, an index.js with the tree, a Sample.xml with a sample found in the project website and (SCHEMA_NAME).xml which is the actual XSD schema.



Each XML tag in the JSON tree is represented the following way:

{
    name:"TAG_NAME"
    content: TURE/FALSE  // depending if it contains text inside, ex: <A>some text</A>
    value: "" // if the tag has content, the value of its default content, by default should be ""
    placeholder:"" // If some information wants to be displayed in the form under the tag name
    childs: [{ ... }], // CHILDS OF THE TAG, if the actual tag doesn't contain any, don't add
    multiple: TRUE/FALSE // IF THIS TAG ALLOWS multiple childs 
    max: integer, // IF THIS TAG ALLOWS multiple childs 
    min:integer, // IF THIS TAG ALLOWS multiple childs 
    meta:{
        META_NAME:{ // the name of actual XML attribute
            value:"",// default value of the attribute
            placeholder:""// Information to be displayed in the input
        },
        {
            ...
        },
        ...
    }
}
